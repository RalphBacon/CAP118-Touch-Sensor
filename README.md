Want to control your PC with an Arduino? Well, you can. Some Arduinos present themselves to your PC & MAC as a keyboard / mouse so you can control your PC as if you were typing on the keyboard yourself.

See how I control my video software using an Adafruit CAP1188 Capacitive Touch Sensor and a Sparkfun Pro Micro - super easy to do.

All material and sketches right here in this repository.
